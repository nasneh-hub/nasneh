# Manus Memory — Nasneh Project

**Purpose:** Persistent context for AI agents working on this project.  
**Edit only when:** Decisions change or new principles are established.

---

## Project Principles

1. **MVP-first** — Ship minimal viable features before enhancements
2. **No assumptions** — If not in repo/docs, ask or mark as unknown
3. **PR-only deliverables** — All code/docs changes via Pull Request
4. **Concise & actionable** — Avoid verbose outputs; respect line limits
5. **No feature creep** — Stick to defined scope unless explicitly approved

---

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Database | PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM | SPECS/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md |
| Authentication | Phone + OTP (WhatsApp → SMS fallback), JWT | SPECS/PRD_MASTER.md |
| Payments | Amazon Payment Services (APS) | SPECS/PRD_MASTER.md |

---

## Key Documents

| Document | Purpose | Priority |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Master Roadmap** | Sprint plan & timeline to MVP | **Check FIRST** |
| PRD | Product requirements | Reference |
| Technical Spec | Architecture & APIs | Reference |
| Design System | UI/UX guidelines | Reference |

**Path:** `docs/SPECS/MASTER_ROADMAP.md` — Check this FIRST for sprint tasks.

---

## Files to Read First (Every Task)

1. `/docs/00_START_HERE.md` — Quick facts and rules
2. `/docs/SPECS/MASTER_ROADMAP.md` — **Current sprint tasks (START HERE)**
3. `/docs/SPECS/PRD_MASTER.md` — What to build (MVP scope)
4. `/docs/SPECS/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` — How to build (architecture)
5. `/docs/SPECS/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — How it looks (UI rules)
6. `/docs/GOVERNANCE/AI_OPERATING_RULES.md` — Rules for AI agents
7. `/docs/MEMORY/PROJECT_TIMELINE.md` — Project history (read last 10 entries)

---

## User Preferences

- Keep outputs **concise** and **actionable**
- Respect **line limits** when specified
- **No feature creep** — do not add unrequested features
- Commit to GitHub via **PR with clear commits**
- Update docs when relevant changes are made


---

## PR Quality Gate

A PR is **NOT "Ready for Review"** unless:

1. **Mergeable** ✅ — No conflicts with base branch
2. **CI Green** ✅ — All GitHub Actions checks pass

**Rule:** Fix/re-run until both conditions are met BEFORE reporting PR as ready.


---

## Post-Merge Verification

After merging any PR to main:

1. **Check CI** — Verify GitHub Actions → CI workflow passes on main
2. **Check CD** — Verify GitHub Actions → CD workflow passes on main (if triggered)
3. **Report status** — Confirm both are green before marking task complete

---

## Secrets Policy

**No secrets in repo / tfvars / plaintext Terraform state.**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Storage | All secrets live in **AWS Secrets Manager** |
| Naming | `nasneh/{env}/api`, `nasneh/{env}/database`, `nasneh/{env}/external` |
| ECS Access | Secrets injected via ARN references in task definition |
| Terraform | Initial placeholders only; real values set via AWS CLI/Console |
| GitHub | Only AWS credentials (IAM) in GitHub Secrets; no app secrets |

### Secret Categories

| Secret | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `nasneh/{env}/api` | JWT_SECRET, JWT_REFRESH_SECRET, OTP_SECRET, REDIS_URL |
| `nasneh/{env}/database` | DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DATABASE_URL |
| `nasneh/{env}/external` | WHATSAPP_API_URL, WHATSAPP_API_TOKEN, SMS_API_URL, SMS_API_KEY |

---

## Deploy Policy

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Auto-deploy | **Disabled by default** |
| Manual deploy | Via `workflow_dispatch` only |
| Approval | Explicit approval required before enabling auto-deploy |

***Rationale:** Staging infrastructure is not yet fully provisioned. Auto-deploy could fail or cause issues until all modules are deployed and secrets are configured.

---

## AWS Permissions for Manus Agent

**IAM User:** `manus-dev`  
**Purpose:** Allow AI agent to monitor and verify AWS infrastructure

### Granted Permissions (Jan 5, 2026)

Custom inline policy attached to `manus-dev` user:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecs:DescribeServices",
        "ecs:DescribeTasks",
        "ecs:DescribeClusters",
        "ecs:ListTasks"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
        "logs:FilterLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetGroups",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetHealth"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Use Cases

- **ECS Monitoring:** Check service status, task definitions, and running tasks
- **Log Analysis:** View CloudWatch logs for debugging and verification
- **Load Balancer Health:** Verify target health and routing configuration

### Security Notes

- Read-only permissions only (no write/delete capabilities)
- No access to secrets, databases, or S3 buckets
- Scoped to monitoring and observability tasks only

| 2026-01-02 18:30 | Memory Freeze initiated | User request |
| 2026-01-02 18:45 | Evidence Inventory compiled | This document |

### Decisions Made

1. **deploy=false verification rule** — Always run CD with deploy=false first to verify image builds
2. **Memory freeze protocol** — After 3+ failed attempts, stop PRs and document
3. **One PR at a time** — No parallel experiments
4. **Log-first rule** — Check CloudWatch/GHA logs before proposing fixes

### Active Constraints

- **STOP PRs** — No new PRs until fix plan approved
- **Log-first** — Must provide log evidence before any theory
- **Single-PR policy** — One focused fix per PR
- **Update PROJECT_STATUS** — After every deployment run

## CD & Database Stabilization Lessons (Jan 2026)

### Problems We Faced & Solutions

| Problem | Root Cause | Solution | PR |
|---------|------------|----------|-----|
| **Provider mismatch** | `schema.prisma` had `mysql`, infrastructure had PostgreSQL | Changed provider to `postgresql` | #120 |
| **Missing tables** | Migrations never ran, no migration files existed | Created initial schema migration | #121 |
| **prisma CLI missing (1st attempt)** | `prisma` was in `devDependencies` | Moved to `dependencies` | #124 |
| **prisma CLI still missing** | `pnpm deploy --prod` excludes CLI binaries even from `dependencies` | Removed `--prod` flag from Dockerfile | #125 |
| **Wrong script path** | Prisma binary path changed after removing `--prod` flag | Updated to `./node_modules/.bin/prisma` | #126 |

### Key Learnings

#### 1. pnpm `--prod` Flag Behavior
**Problem:** `pnpm deploy --prod` excludes CLI binaries even when they are in `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`).

**Why:** The `--prod` flag is designed to create the smallest possible production bundle by excluding:
- All `devDependencies`
- CLI binaries and scripts
- Development tools

**Solution:** Remove `--prod` flag when CLI tools (like `prisma`) are needed in production for migrations.

**Trade-off:** Slightly larger image size (~10MB) vs. ability to run migrations.

#### 2. Prisma Schema Provider Must Match Infrastructure
**Problem:** `schema.prisma` had `provider = "mysql"` but Terraform deployed PostgreSQL.

**Root Cause:** Initial schema was created with MySQL provider, but infrastructure decision was PostgreSQL.

**Lesson:** Always verify `schema.prisma` provider matches deployed database type **before** running migrations.

**Validation Command:**
```bash
# Check schema provider
grep "provider" apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma

# Check RDS engine
aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].Engine'
```

#### 3. Prisma Client vs. Prisma CLI
**Problem:** `@prisma/client` (library) ≠ `prisma` (CLI tool).

**Key Distinction:**
- `@prisma/client`: Runtime library for database queries (always needed)
- `prisma`: CLI tool for migrations, schema management (only needed for migrations)

**Lesson:** Both packages are required in production if migrations run in production containers.

#### 4. Migration Script Path Depends on Build Configuration
**Problem:** Prisma binary path changed after removing `--prod` flag.

**Paths:**
```bash
# With --prod flag (nested in @prisma/client)
./node_modules/@prisma/client/node_modules/.bin/prisma

# Without --prod flag (standard location)
./node_modules/.bin/prisma
```

**Lesson:** Migration scripts must be updated when Dockerfile build configuration changes.

#### 5. Always Test Docker Builds in Codespaces
**Problem:** Multiple failed deployments due to untested Docker builds.

**Lesson:** Before merging Dockerfile changes:
1. Open GitHub Codespaces on the PR branch
2. Run `docker build -f apps/api/Dockerfile -t test .`
3. Run `docker run -p 4000:4000 -e DATABASE_URL=... test`
4. Test `/health` and one DB endpoint

**Quality Gate:** Docker build + local run must pass before merge.

#### 6. Migration Files Must Exist Before Running Migrations
**Problem:** `prisma migrate deploy` failed because no migration files existed in the repo.

**Root Cause:** Prisma schema was created but `prisma migrate dev` was never run to generate migration files.

**Lesson:** After creating/modifying `schema.prisma`:
1. Run `prisma migrate dev --name description` locally
2. Commit generated files in `prisma/migrations/`
3. Deploy with `prisma migrate deploy` in production

**Migration Files Structure:**
```
apps/api/prisma/
├── schema.prisma
├── migrations/
│   ├── migration_lock.toml
│   └── 20260103_initial_schema/
│       └── migration.sql
```

#### 7. ECS Task Run-Task for One-Time Operations
**Pattern:** Use `aws ecs run-task` with command overrides for one-time operations like migrations.

**Example:**
```bash
aws ecs run-task \
  --cluster nasneh-staging-cluster \
  --task-definition nasneh-staging-api:11 \
  --launch-type FARGATE \
  --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={...}" \
  --overrides '{"containerOverrides":[{"name":"api","command":["sh","./scripts/run-migrations.sh"]}]}'
```

**Benefits:**
- Same network/security configuration as service
- Same Docker image as deployed service
- Isolated from running service (no downtime)
- Exit code verification (0 = success)

#### 8. CloudWatch Logs Are Essential for Debugging
**Lesson:** Always check CloudWatch logs before proposing fixes.

**Log Groups:**
```
/ecs/nasneh-staging/api
```

**Log Stream Pattern:**
```
api/api/{task-id}
```

**Command:**
```bash
aws logs get-log-events \
  --log-group-name "/ecs/nasneh-staging/api" \
  --log-stream-name "api/api/{task-id}" \
  --limit 50
```

## Migration Automation (Future)

### Current State (Manual)
1. Merge PR with schema changes
2. Run CD to build new image
3. Manually run ECS task for migrations
4. Verify API endpoints

### Future State (Automated)
Add migration step to CD pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Run Migrations
  run: |
    aws ecs run-task \
      --cluster ${{ env.CLUSTER }} \
      --task-definition ${{ env.TASK_DEF }} \
      --overrides '{"containerOverrides":[{"name":"api","command":["sh","./scripts/run-migrations.sh"]}]}'
    # Wait for task completion
    # Verify exit code = 0
```

**Blocker:** Requires ECS task wait/poll logic in GitHub Actions.

**Priority:** Medium (manual process works, automation is enhancement).

### UI Law CI Enforcement

Implemented strict CI checks for UI Laws:

| Check | Rule | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Hex Colors | No #FFFFFF, #000, etc. | ✅ Enforced |
| Tailwind Colors | No bg-white, text-black, etc. | ✅ Enforced |
| Inline Styles | No style={{...}} | ✅ Enforced |
| Border Classes | No border-* classes | ✅ Enforced |
| Border Radius | Only rounded-xl, rounded-full | ✅ Enforced |
| Forbidden Terms | No زبون، بائع، customer, vendor in UI | ✅ Enforced |
| Hardcoded Arabic | Must use copy tokens | ✅ Enforced |
| Font Family | Only Vazirmatn | ✅ Enforced |
| External UI Libs | No @mui, antd, chakra-ui | ✅ Enforced |
| className Prop | No className on @nasneh/ui components | ✅ Enforced |

### Key PRs

| PR | Description | SP |
|----|-------------|-----|
| #199 | First 6 core components | 3 |
| #201 | Add modification rules to tokens.css | 1 |
| #203 | Add remaining 6 core components | 4 |
| #204 | Customer Phone + OTP Login Flow | 5 |
| #208 | Customer Profile & Address Management | 5 |
| #210 | Dashboard Login & Role Switching | 6 |

### CI Fixes During Sprint 4

Multiple CI workflow fixes were needed for the UI Law enforcement:

| PR | Fix |
|----|-----|
| #206 | Add word boundaries to prevent localStorage false positive |
| #209 | Exclude Arabic punctuation from hardcoded text check |
| #211 | Exclude route paths and TypeScript keys |
| #212 | Improve comment exclusions |
| #213 | Restore proper workflow structure |
| #214 | Add `\s*` to href pattern for optional spaces |

### Lessons Learned

1. **UI Law CI is Critical:** Strict enforcement catches violations early
2. **Regex Patterns Need Testing:** Always test grep patterns with real code samples
3. **Route Paths Contain Role Names:** `/vendor`, `/admin` routes trigger forbidden terminology check - need exclusions
4. **Copy Tokens Work:** All Arabic text comes from centralized ar.ts file

### Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Lines Added** | ~3,500 |
| **New Components** | 12 |
| **New Pages** | 10 (customer-web + dashboard) |
| **PRs Merged** | 12+ |
| **Story Points** | 24 |
| **Duration** | 3 days |
| **MVP Progress** | 85% → 95% |

### Next: Sprint 5

**Focus:** Frontend Core Features  
**Story Points:** 24  
**Goal:** Product browsing, cart, checkout, booking flow
